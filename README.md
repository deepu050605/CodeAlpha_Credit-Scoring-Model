# ðŸ§  Credit Scoring Model

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This project aims to build a predictive machine learning model that assesses an individual's *creditworthiness* using historical financial data. By analyzing features such as income, outstanding debts, and payment history, the model classifies individuals as either *creditworthy (good)* or *non-creditworthy (risky)*.

## ðŸ›  Problem Statement
Lenders and financial institutions need reliable tools to evaluate the risk of loan default. This model helps in making data-driven decisions by predicting the probability of default based on historical financial indicators.

### Key Features:
- income: Annual income of the individual
- debts: Outstanding debt amount
- payment_history: Indicator of timely payments
- missed_payments: Number of missed payments
- creditworthy: Target variable (1 = Yes, 0 = No)

## ðŸ§ª Approach

The task is treated as a *binary classification problem*. The following supervised learning algorithms are implemented:

- âœ… Logistic Regression  
- âœ… Random Forest Classifier  

The data is preprocessed using scaling techniques, and models are evaluated using both *threshold-based* and *probability-based* performance metrics.

## âš™ Tech Stack

- *Language*: Python
- *Libraries*:
  - pandas, numpy â€“ Data manipulation
  - scikit-learn â€“ ML algorithms, model evaluation
  - matplotlib, seaborn â€“ Visualization

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics
